"It's a logical title applied by me when I decided to describe its function in one or two words. Any brilliant scientist would have arrived at approximately the same title if given the chance."

This is my first experience into prop making.  I've selected parts based on price and general shape of what existed in the actual prop.  The basic parts consist of a tin box, pvc elbows, an ethernet cable, an led strip, and an Arduino Uno.  I painted the pvc elbows with bronze and red to mimic the brass risers and the cable covers.  Then, I cut the ethernet cable into short pieces and fit them into the end of the elbows.  After that, I soldered some wire onto my led strips and assembled the face of my flux capacitor.  After assembling the face, I cut a small hole into the side of the tin box and snapped a power switch into place.  Finally, I fit the battery pack which holds 4 AA batteries and the Arduino into the box and set the face on top of those.  Everything is held in place after the lid is closed.
