"A silver ring depicting a snake that could have been, but never was, a dragon.  Fallen foes yield more souls.
Snakes are known as creatures of great avarice, devouring prey even larger than themselves by swallowing them whole.
If one's shackles are cause for discontent, perhaps it is time for some old-fashioned greed."

This is my first attempt at making jewelry, so I decided to create my own version of one of my favorite rings from the Dark Souls series.  I made this ring while taking a jewelry metalsmithing class at my local art center.  I used half-round silver wire and cut a herring bone pattern on the top of the wire then bent it to shape.  I then balled and shaped the head and finished the piece by oxidizing and giving a light sanding.
