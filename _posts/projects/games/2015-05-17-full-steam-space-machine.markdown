Terrorize the galaxy in your Spacemachine by shooting down any opposition you face. Some of their ships will drop upgrades that increase the number of shots you have, your fire rate, and the size of your shot. Be on the look out for the steam cannisters that will allow you to enter Full Steam mode. Entering Full Steam will destroy any enemy ships near you while also pushing you over the speed of light. How long can you survive? Can you get the high score? Can you eliminate an entire population of peace loving space police? ...Yes? You monster.

This game was made as part of a 48 hour game jam in which the game was to be based on a song or lyric of our choice. We based our game on 'Full Steam Spacemachine' by Royal Republic and we placed 3rd. We built this game to be played on the Oculus Rift and a custom arcade panel. It can, however also be played with mouse/keyboard or an Xbox controller.
